%Notice here the distinctive manner of citation -- and, see further the way the pinpoint references are inputted into the text. (This is another virtue of Latex: it's hard to do this with these cases on MS Word.)

% I have used this case in part as it contains a ship name. If you want a very good table of cases, ship names should be listed separately. Paul Stanley's Readme for OSCOLA describes this in more detail. 
%The year-essential=true is to prevent Latex from making what should be square brackets (e.g. [1940]) into curved brackets (e.g. (1940).) This is necessary whenever there is a `volume' input. Compare:

keywords = {gb},
date = {1936},
court = {HL},
reporter = {Com. Cas.},
volume = {41},
pages = {350},}
%Here, the report requires curly brackets and so does not need the `essential=true' input. This all might seem quite cumbersome, but it really isn't: I simply inputted almost all my cases with the essential=true addition and then took it out where required.

%Note the `number' is the way of inputting neutral citations. 
%Note, further, that the pagination is set to paragraphs, so your pinpoints will take you to the paragraph number you input rather than the page. 

%To show how the different countries' cases are inputted, and to show how they show up on the table of cases, I will give a Canadian, Australian and USA case next. These can, if preferred, be consolidated into one table of cases; at the moment, they are separated out.
