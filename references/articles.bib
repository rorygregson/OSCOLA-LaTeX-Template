%You can import citations from Endnote, though I found this only worked so well. Changing my previous citations to be Tex compliant was the most painstaking part of the process. So, if you can start building the citation document early on that will be helpful for you. 

@article{opeskin,
   author = {Opeskin, B},
   title = {Damages for Breach of Contract Terminated under Express Terms},
   journal = {LQR},
   volume = {106},
   pages = {293},
   year = {1990}
}

@article{reynolds63,
   author = {Reynolds, F},
   title = {Warranty, Condition and Fundamental Term},
   journal = {LQR},
   volume = {79},
   pages = {534},
   year = {1963}
}

@article{reynolds81,
   author = {Reynolds, F},
   title = {Discharge of Contract by Breach},

%Notice the name of the article -- here `reynolds81' -- is your way of inputting the article into the main text. So, it's important to come up with a name which you will find easy to recall. Note, too, that it's important to keep the names of similarly titled/ authored works separate -- as here with two different papers of Francis Reynolds.
